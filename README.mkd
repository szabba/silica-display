# Visualisation for SILICA

The program visualises a piece of porous silicate glass and magnetic
nanoparticles under it's influence. Both the glass piece and particle movements
are described by input files (of which only the glass file is necessary.

## Usage

```
> python display.py [OPTIONS] GLASS_FILE
```

## Glass file

The glass file must be named `dataWIDTHxHEIGHTxDEPTHtNUMBER_NUMBER.dat` for the
program to properly guess the glass piece's size. The glass is shown as built
from cubes of unit size with integer coordinates.

The file can contain any number of lines, each containing 4 numbers separated
by single spaces. The first three are the (x, y, z) coordinates of a glass
cube. The last one is 1 when a cube is present at the coordinates, and 0 when
it's not.

The same spatial coordinates must not appear in multiple lines of a glass file.
The program behaviour when they do is left unspecified.

Line ordering doesn't matter. Lines ending in 0s can be safely omitted.

An example follows.

```
0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1
2 2 2 1
```

Yes, it is not a very imaginative example.

## Particle animation file

Using the `-p`/`--particles` option, the user may specify a file containing
particle animation data. It's first line should contain the number of
particles to be rendered in each frame.

The following lines should contain six numbers each. The first three are the
cartesian coordinates of the center of a particle. The following three are the
components of the normalised magnetic moment.

Frames are not delimeted in any way. If a valid file has 41 lines and the first
one contains the number 4, it contains 10 frames.

An example follows.

```
1
0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
```

Yes, it is not a very imaginative example.

# User interface

The application is controlled through the mouse and keyboard.

## Camera control

The camera looks at a certain point. Dragging with the Left Mouse Button
rotates the view around this point. Not all rotations are possible to make.

As an aid in understanding the current camera orientation, the coordinate
system axes are displayed in the lower left corner of the window. In line with
the usual 3D graphics convention the x axis is red, the y axis is green and the
z axis is blue.

Dragging with the Right Mouse Button translates the camera parallel to the
screen plane. Scrolling the mouse wheel zooms the camera in/out. Pressing C on
the keyboard will reset all the camera parameters.

## Particle playback control

Pressing Space will toggle the particle animation playback. Pressign L will
toggle whether the animation loops. Pressing the left/right arrow key will move
one frame backward/forward, irrespective of whether the animation is currently
playing or not.

# Dependencies

To run the program you will need:

* Python 2.7
* Pyglet 1.1
* Numpy 1.8
* Scipy 0.14
* GCC 4.9

The versions specified are the ones the program has been extensively run
against. It might work just fine with other ones.

# Language usage statistic

The program is written in a combination of three different languages and
uses several not-so-simple libraries and APIs.

files.
      25 unique files.

```

That gives a total of

* 1773 lines of Python
* 175 lines of the OpenGL Shading Language
* 34 lines of C

`custom.cloc` contains the language specification for GLSL (so that `cloc` can
count shader sources).
